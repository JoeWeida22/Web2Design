# Iron Man: Final Project Website

This project is a 3-page website dedicated to Iron Man and his legacy in the Marvel Universe. It includes a homepage, a biography section, and a gallery of his iconic armor suits.

## Reflection

**What’s something new you learned while building your site?**  
While building this site, I learned how to use Bootstrap's grid system and components like cards and navbars to create clean and responsive layouts. I especially enjoyed customizing Bootstrap elements with my own CSS to make the site feel unique.

**How did you balance creativity with usability?**  
I used bold red and black colors to represent Iron Man's theme, but made sure there was enough contrast to keep everything readable. I also kept navigation simple and used large headings and clear image captions to help users explore the content easily.

**What are you most proud of in your final project?**  
I’m most proud of the gallery section. It’s responsive and uses Bootstrap cards to display Iron Man’s suits with style and clarity. It feels professional and showcases what I’ve learned about layout and design.
